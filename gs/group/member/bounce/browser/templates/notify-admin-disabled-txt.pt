<tal:block
  define="m string:There is a problem with the email address of ${userInfo/name}, who is a member of your group ${view/groupInfo/name}. Posts from your group to the email address of the member — ${email} — have been repeatedly returned by the provider of the address. Because of this, the email address has been disabled, so ${userInfo/name} will no longer be able to post to the group, nor can the member receive posts from the group."

There are a few things you can do to resolve this situation.


*Remove* *the* *member*

<tal:block
  define="m string:One possibility is that ${userInfo/name} wants to stop receiving posts from the group — so has been marking posts as spam, which has caused the posts to be returned. In this case it would be best to remove ${userInfo/name} from your group:"
  content="python:view.indent_fill(m)" />
    <tal:block content="string:${view/groupInfo/url}/managemembers.html?showOnly=${userInfo/id}"/>


*Try* *and* *resolve* *the* *problem*

<tal:block
  define="m string:You can also contact ${userInfo/name} and try to resolve the problem that is causing emails from your group to be returned."
  content="python:view.indent_fill(m)" />

<tal:block
  define="m string:${userInfo/name} may need to add the email address for the group — ${view/groupEmail} — as an email contact. Here are some instructions on how to do this:"

<tal:block
  define="m string:You can help ${userInfo/name} change which email address is used to receive email from the group, possibly adding a new address. (Check to see if ${userInfo/name} has changed jobs, because sometimes old email addresses stop working.)"
  content="python:view.indent_bullet_fill(m)" />

<tal:block
  define="m string:You can ask ${userInfo/name} if there is enough space with the email account. If the member runs out of space email cannot be delivered."
