<tal:block
  define="m string:A post from ${view/groupInfo/name} was send to you at your address ${email}. However, your email provider sent the post back to us. (This is known as an email bounce.)"

<tal:block
  define="m string:There are a few things that you can do to ensure that you get posts from ${view/groupInfo/name}."
  content="python:view.fill(m)" />

* Add the email address for the group to your email contacts:
  <tal:block content="view/groupEmail">group@elists.example.com</tal:block>

* Change which email address you use, either for the group, or
  change your preferred email address for all your groups.
  <tal:block content="string:${view/siteInfo/url}${userInfo/url}/emailsettings.html"/>

* Check that you have enough space with your email account. If
  you run out of space email cannot be delivered to you.

* Finally, the problem may be transient, in which case you should
  do nothing.

<tal:block
  define="m string:If messages from any of your groups to ${email} have problems on five separate days in a sixty-day period then we will disable posting to that address. We will email you at this address if that happens."
  content="python:view.fill(m)" />

If you have any problems, email us at
  <tal:block content="view/siteInfo/get_support_email">this address</tal:block>

Kind regards,
  The <tal:block content="view/siteInfo/name">Site</tal:block> Team
