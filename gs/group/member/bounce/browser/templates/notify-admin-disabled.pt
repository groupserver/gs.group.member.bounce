      <p>
        Dear
        <span class="fn" tal:content="adminInfo/name">Admin</span>,
      </p>
      <!-- Explain what has happened.-->
      <p>
        There is a problem with the email address of
        <a class="fn"
           tal:attributes="href string:${view/siteInfo/url}${userInfo/url}"
           tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</a>,
        who is a member of your group
        <a class="group"
           tal:attributes="href view/groupInfo/url"
           tal:content="view/groupInfo/name">this group</a>.
        Posts from your group to the email address of the member
        <code class="email"
              tal:content="email">a.member@example.com</code>
        have been repeatedly returned by the provider of the
        address.
        Because of this, the email address has been
        <strong>disabled</strong> &#8213;
        so
        <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
        will no longer be able to post to the group,
        nor can the member receive posts from the group.
      </p>
      <!-- What to do about it -->
      <p>
        There are a few things you can do to resolve this situation.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <!-- Remove the person from the group -->
        <dt>
          Remove the member
        </dt>
        <dd>
          One possibility is that
          <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
          wants to stop receiving posts from the group, so has
          been marking posts as spam, which has caused the posts
          to be returned.
          In this case it would be best to
          <a href="#"
             tal:attributes="href string:${view/groupInfo/url}/managemembers.html?showOnly=${userInfo/id}">remove
            <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
            from
            <span class="group"
                  tal:content="view/groupInfo/name">this group</span>.
          </a>
        </dd>
        <!-- Email the person and help them fix the problem-->
        <dt>
          Try and resolve the problem
        </dt>
        <dd>
          You can also contact
          <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
          and try to resolve the problem that is causing emails
          from your group to be returned.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <!-- * Add the group email-address as a contact -->
              <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
              may need to add the email address for the group &#8213;
              <code class="email"
                    tal:content="view/groupEmail">group@elists.example.com</code>
               &#8213; as an <strong>email contact.</strong>

              may help you do this.
              <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
              will need to verify the email address
              <a tal:attributes="href string:mailto:${email}"
                 href="#"><code
                            class="email"
                            tal:content="email">a.member@example.com</code></a>
              after the group email address has been added as a contact.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can help
              <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
              change which email address is used to receive email
              from the group, possibly <strong>adding</strong> a
              new address.
              (Check to see if
              <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
              has changed jobs, because sometimes old email
              addresses stop working.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- * Check that your inbox is not full -->
              You can ask
              <span class="fn" tal:content="userInfo/name">A. Member</span>
              if there is enough space with the email account.
              If the member runs out of space email cannot be delivered.
            </li>
          </ul>
